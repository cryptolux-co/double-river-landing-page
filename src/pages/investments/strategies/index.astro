          Good opportunities are everywhere, and we donâ€™t put limits on ourselves. We are just as
          comfortable making investments in small Vietnamese companies as we are investing in the
          largest global names. And whether those opportunities are in public shares, derivatives or
          the FX markets, we are there.

          Our investment strategies are quantitative, well- tested, and unemotional. Whether based
          on novel deep learning algorithms or tried-and-tested statistical models, our systems
          identify various kinds of market inefficiencies.
